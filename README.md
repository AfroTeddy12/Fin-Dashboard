## API Endpoints

The application provides the following REST API endpoints:

### Transactions
- `GET /api/transactions` - Get all transactions
- `POST /api/transactions` - Add a new transaction
- `DELETE /api/transactions/<id>` - Delete a transaction

### Budgets
- `GET /api/budgets` - Get current month budgets
- `POST /api/budgets` - Add a new budget

### Goals
- `GET /api/goals` - Get all financial goals
- `POST /api/goals` - Add a new goal
- `PUT /api/goals/<id>` - Update goal progress

### Analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/summary` - Get financial summary
- `GET /api/analytics/chart-data` - Get chart data

## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with three main tables:

### Transactions
- `id`: Primary key
- `description`: Transaction description
- `amount`: Transaction amount
- `category`: Spending category
- `transaction_type`: 'income' or 'expense'
- `date`: Transaction date
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### Budgets
- `id`: Primary key
- `category`: Budget category
- `amount`: Budget amount
- `month`: Month (YYYY-MM format)
- `created_at`: Timestamp

### Goals
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Goal name
- `target_amount`: Target savings amount
- `current_amount`: Current savings amount
- `deadline`: Goal deadline
- `created_at`: Timestamp

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
To add new spending categories, edit the select options in `templates/index.html` in both the transaction and budget forms.

### Changing Colors
The color scheme can be customized by modifying the CSS variables in the `<style>` section of `templates/index.html`.

### Database Location
The SQLite database file (`finance.db`) is automatically created in the project root directory when you first run the application.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: If you get an error about port 5000 being in use, the application will automatically try port 5001.

2. **Database errors**: If you encounter database issues, delete the `finance.db` file and restart the application to create a fresh database.

3. **Charts not loading**: Make sure you have an internet connection as Chart.js is loaded from a CDN.

### Getting Help
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check the terminal/command prompt for Python errors
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- User authentication and multiple user support
